The main departmental labs available to undergraduates are ENG201/202/203/205, ENG206 and ENG211. The lab schedule is available [here](http://scs.ryerson.ca/labs.php). 

When the George Vari Engineering and Computing Centre becomes key locked on weekends and weekday evenings, the labs lock as well. At these times you will still be able to enter the labs, just remember to bring your OneCards. Only Computer Science students will be able to unlock CS Labs with their OneCards.

## Lab Schedules

Below is a table of the schedules labs for undergraduate-accessible lab rooms. These are the same schedules posted on the doors of each room.
