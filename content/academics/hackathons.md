From Wikipedia:

>A hackathon (also known as a hack day, hackfest or codefest) is a design sprint-like event in which computer programmers and others involved in software development, including graphic designers, interface designers, project managers, and others, often including subject-matter-experts, collaborate intensively on software projects.

They are typically free of charge and provide attendees with many opportunities:

- Networking opportunities with students from other universties
- Networking opportunities with employers who use hackathons as recruitement grounds
- Using hackathons as an opportunity to use a new technology
- Learning new technologies by attending free hackathon workshops/lectures (ex. Android development workshop)
- Sponsor challenges where winning teams can win prizes, which can be monetary, devices and/or interviews with the sponsor company
