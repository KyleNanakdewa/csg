While the official [course calendar](https://www.ryerson.ca/calendar/2018-2019/courses/computer-science/) is always at your disposal, it does not always tell the full story about how these courses are taught. The summaries are vague by design.

The goal of this page is to crowdsource **opinionated** information and **anecdotes** from students during their course experiences. What is on this page may not be completely true or accurate, but the end goal is to create a space for students to disseminate common experiences in courses to prepare and help future students.

### Fall 2013
During this semester this course was taught by Dr. Derpanis, Dr. Harley and Dr. Ferworn. The course used the textbook *Big Java: Early Objects* which meant that object oriented programming was taught in this course. There were two projects, one to build a program that would accept an input to simulate the turning and unlocking of a padlock, the other to simulate a poker game. There was weekly homework and a weekly submittable lab. There were two midterms, and the second midterm allowed students to retake it to improve their grade. Both the midterms and the final were done paperless, using the wizard testing environment.
