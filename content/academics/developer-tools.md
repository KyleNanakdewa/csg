Many companies allow university students use of their products free of use. Note that some of the licences of the products listed below may only be for educational purposes. 

## GitHub Student Pack

>There's no substitute for hands-on experience, but for most students, real world tools can be cost prohibitive. That's why we created the GitHub Student Developer Pack with some of our partners and friends: to give students free access to the best developer tools in one place so they can learn by doing.
