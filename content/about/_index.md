This site is a collective effort by Ryerson University computer science students. It was created firstly, to facilitate knowledge dissemination within the program, in a central location and run completely independently by students.

The hugo site generator was chosen to allow for easy and transparent collaboration through GitHub. This achieves two things. First, anyone is able to make their changes through a simple public pull request. This also means there is a small (but necessary) barrier of entry to make edits. Secondly, it exposes contributors to git, markdown, and the reading of documentation, all three of which are quite useful skills to have in the field.
