## First Login

Initially when your account is first created, your password will be in the format: MMDDXXXX (where MM is your Birth-Month, DD is your Birthday, and XXXX is the last four digits of your student ID number). When you login for the first time, you will be asked to change your password. 

Your new password must be at least 8 characters long. The password must contain three different classes (Upper letters, Lower letters, Numbers, and Punctuation marks). NOTE: Your Computer Science Username may be different from your Ryerson Username. Please make sure to use your CS Username in all Computer Science labs.
